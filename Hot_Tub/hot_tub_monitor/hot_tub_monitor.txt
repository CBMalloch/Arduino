Notes:
  hot tub fill monitor to be modified to tie into RS-485 hub
   
  v separate board for display output - SPI
    -- note my display cards up to v1.1 are mislabeled, swapping MOSI and MISO labels!
  o 7833 to power XBee, or use an Adafruit adapter
  o XBee to receive hot tub status - to digital inputs
  v nearby ds75 for outdoor temperature - I2C
  v on-board light sensor - analog input
  o status LEDs
    HT Ozone
    HT pre-run
    HT run
    HT cover
  v separate board for POE
    2 RJ-45 ( in parallel )
    1 terminal strip for 5V power, RS485
    1 TO-220 7805
    1 MAX423 RS485 adapter
  
Steps:

  
  v create 3 RS-485 / cbmBus hubs, using Eagle CAD and OSH Park 
    submitted for build 2013-05-17 received 2013-05-29
    o build models for the RJ-45 receptacles I have, both the one-port and the two-port ones
    o modify to use the available RJ-45s for future builds (not the SparkFun ones I used before)
    POE_RS-485_v1.1 / RS-485 and power over Ethernet
  v create Eagle board for LED output device $15/3 = $5 => total per board of $18 + supplies + labor 
    submitted for build 2013-05-17 received 2013-05-29
    o test with 7219
    o modify board for future builds
      o move resistor out from under LED display
      o add popcorn caps across power supply
  v build XBee adapter
  v prototype / build ambient-light measuring circuit for brightness control
  o concoct hot-tub-open sensor - ultrasonic rangefinder?
  v prototype / build XBee receiving
  
  v prototype / build slave hardware to combine all the pieces
  v create slave program
  
  v create master program or add master functionality to heating panel Arduino
    or make furnace Arduino master and broadcast all via XBee
  x use EarthLCD.com arduinoLCD / arLCD for display etc. ?
