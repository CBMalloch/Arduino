  Heavily modified by Charles B. Malloch, PhD  2013-02-12
  Mainly to allow me to use either hardware serial or SoftwareSerial for the RS485 communications
  But then also for my peculiar anally-motivated readability standards
  
  Note that in main program, one should define coilArray thus:
    unsigned short coils[ ( nCoils + 15 ) >> 4 ];
